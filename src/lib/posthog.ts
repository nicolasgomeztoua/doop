/* Session replay + exception capture + web vitals are compiled into our
   bundle (instead of posthog-js lazy-loading them from PostHog's CDN at
   runtime), and the no-external build guarantees nothing else is remotely
   loaded. Combined with the same-origin /relay proxy this makes analytics
   first-party end to end: there is no PostHog-owned URL for blockers to
   match, so replay works for effectively every user.

   posthog-recorder (not the legacy dist/recorder) is required: the SDK only
   starts replay when the entrypoint registers BOTH __PosthogExtensions__
   .rrweb and .initSessionRecording, and the legacy recorder lacks the
   latter — replay then waits on a lazy load that the no-external build can
   never perform and every session sticks at $recording_status
   "lazy_loading". */
