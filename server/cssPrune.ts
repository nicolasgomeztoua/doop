 * frame HTML on every get_frame call. Matching selectors against the
 * captured DOM keeps only what styles this page.
 *
 * The browser is the CSS parser: the sheet is injected into the page and
 * walked through CSSOM, so there is no parser dependency and no drift between
 * what we keep and what Chromium understands.
